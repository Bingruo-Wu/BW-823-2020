## Welcome to Bingruo Wu's GitHub Pages

I am currently a second year master student studying statistical sciences at Duke University. This is a website I prepared for my big data class. In this page, I'll describe how I did my first assignment - build my personal website on GitHub Pages.

### Procedures

For starters, I created a new repository under my Github account and named it as the name of this course BIOSTAT823-2020. Then I went to the setting of this repository and under the GitHub Page section, I saved 'master' as the source for my website. After this, I chose one Jekyll theme for my personal website. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
