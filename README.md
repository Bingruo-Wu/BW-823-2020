## Welcome to Bingruo Wu's GitHub Pages

I am currently a second year master student studying statistical sciences at Duke University. This is a website I prepared for my big data class: BIOTSTAT823- 2020 Fall. In this page, I am going to describe how I finish my first assignment for this course: Start a personal website at Github Pages.

### Procedures

For starters, I created a new repository specifically used for this course and named as BW-823-2020 and chose to build it for public. Then I used the master branch as the root source for this website. After this, I used Jekyll as the blogging tool and chose to use Slate as the theme. 

### HW2

#### P7: What is the 10001st prime

For this question, I checked whether a number is a prime number by checking if it is divisible by numbers <= it's square root, which is also the idea how I set up the anonymous function Lambda. Therefore, the 10001st prime for this question is 104743.

#### P52: Permuted Multiples

I used the while loop to count how many iterations we need before reaching the smallest integer x, which makes 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits. Therefore, the final answer for this question is 142857.

#### P80ï¼šSquare root digital expansion

I first imported the decimal module to set the precision for this question to be 102, since we are aske to find the sum of the first one hundred decimal digits for the first one hundred natural numbers and all the square roots have to be irrational. Also, I seperated each digit and the decimal point by 'str()' and added digits at the left of the decimal with all at the right side. Therefore, the final answer for this question is 40886.
